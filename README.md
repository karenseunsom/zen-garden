<h1>CSS Zen Garden</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project was to brush up on existing CSS skills, learn new ones, and remember how much styling can be done without bootstrap.</p>
<p>In this particular project, modifying the HTML was not allowed which made it a little more challenging.</p>

<h3>Some things I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CSS Grid</li>
  <li>Responsive design with media queries</li>
  <li>Pseudo classes and elements</li>
  <li>Making a curvy background from scratch</li>
  <li>The hsl property</li>
</ul>

<h4> I also learned...</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I should Spend a little more time beforehand thinking about what design I want to go for</li>
  <li>Your HTML really doesn't need to turn into div soup</li>
  <li>I should frequently check mobile responsiveness instead of towards the end</li>
</ul>
